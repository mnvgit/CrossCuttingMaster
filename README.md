CrossCuttingMaster is a modern .NET 8 web application template that demonstrates robust cross-cutting concern handling using MediatR, FluentValidation, and custom middleware. 
The project is designed to help you build scalable, maintainable, and testable APIs by centralizing common concerns such as validation, exception handling, performance monitoring, and audit logging.

‚Ä¢	.NET 8 Web API: Built on the latest .NET platform for maximum performance and long-term support.
‚Ä¢	MediatR Integration: Implements the mediator pattern for clean separation of business logic and infrastructure, supporting request/response, notifications, and pipeline behaviors.
‚Ä¢	FluentValidation: Provides a fluent interface for model validation, integrated seamlessly into the MediatR pipeline.
‚Ä¢	Custom Pipeline Behaviors:
‚Ä¢	Performance Monitoring: Logs warnings for slow requests, with configurable thresholds.
‚Ä¢	Audit Logging: Automatically logs all requests and responses, including errors, for traceability and compliance.
‚Ä¢	Global Exception Handling: Centralized error handling with customizable responses and support for ProblemDetails.
‚Ä¢	Extensible Architecture: Easily add or modify cross-cutting behaviors to suit your project‚Äôs needs.
